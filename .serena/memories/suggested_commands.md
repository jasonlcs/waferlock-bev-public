- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start dev server with hot reload: `npm run dev`
- Production build output to `dist/`: `npm run build`
- Preview production build locally: `npm run preview`
- Deploy static build to GitHub Pages: `npm run deploy`
- Format/check TypeScript types during development: rely on Vite dev server console (no dedicated lint script yet).
